            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul> 2. Your Contract
            <li>
              2.1 A "booking" means any order for products or services you make on our Website which is confirmed by us.
              When you make a booking via this website, this contract will be between the travel supplier and you and
              not between Mehman and you. Therefore, Mehman is not a party to the contractual relationship in relation
              to the products and services you order on our Website. Any queries or concerns relating to the product
              should be addressed to the Travel Supplier.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.2 The term "Travel Supplier" includes as appropriate airlines, hotels, tour operators, package holiday
              suppliers, hotels and hotel aggregators, insurance suppliers and rental car suppliers
            </li>
            <li>
              2.3 Mehman makes the booking on your behalf and your contract will be subject to the Travel Supplier's
              terms and conditions, which could limit or exclude liability to you (often in accordance with various
              applicable international conventions). If you wish to review the relevant Travel Supplier's terms, we
              refer you to the Conditions of Carriage page of our Website where the Travel Supplier's terms are
              available through a link. In instances where it is not possible to access the Travel Supplier's terms by a
              link, we will at your request provide the Travel Supplier's contact details so that you may contact them.
              Please ensure you refer to the applicable Travel Supplier's terms and conditions for cancellation charges
              and other important terms and conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.4 By using this Website to book products and/or services, you authorise Mehman to act as your
              representative during the process of comparison between Travel Suppliers and booking of products and/or
              services from the selected Travel Supplier and to make the payment for such products or services in your
              name and on your behalf, as required. Accordingly, Mehman shall charge you with a service fee, depending
              upon which product you book. You will be advised of any fee before you confirm your booking. Where you
              provide us with the details of your credit card or debit card to make your flight booking, you authorise
              us to use these details to make the flight booking on your behalf. When payment is made in this way by us
              on your behalf, you will receive a confirmed ticket issued by the operator of your flight.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.5 Prices are confirmed at the final step of the booking path at the point when you click "Buy now",
              "Book now" or similar, depending on product purchased. Prices are shown with rates of exchange calculated
              on a daily basis. Prices may therefore differ on a daily basis to reflect any movement in exchange rate
              levels. Taxes fluctuate in line with exchange rates. When a booking is made the exchange rate will be
              fixed at that time and will apply to any amendments or cancellations to that item within the booking.
              Exchange rates are determined by Mehman.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.6 After you confirm your booking, you will receive a confirmation email with a booking number. This is
              the moment that your contract in relation to the products and services ordered will come into existence.
              This confirmation email will provide all the details of the itinerary of your booking. Our obligation to
              issue the ticket will be subject to your payment having been received in cleared funds. Once payment has
              been made for your flight you will receive a confirmed ticket issued by the operator of the flight. This
              will usually be within a few minutes of payment having been made. Your contract of carriage with the
              operator is therefore directly enforceable against the operator without any intervention by us.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.7 We reserve the right to cancel your booking immediately in the event we have reasonable grounds to
              believe it is fraudulent, in such circumstances you will either not be charged or any money shall be
              refunded to you. Mehman will have no liability whatsoever for any loss in such circumstances.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul> 3. Refunds
            <li>
              3.1 In the event that a refund is due to You, the relevant refund amounts will be transferred back to the
              same payment card/bank account used to make the original booking
            </li>
            <li>
              3.2 Where a refund is due to be processed by the relevant airline, please note that it will be processed
              according to their policies and timelines which are outside of Mehman’s control. Please check e ticket
              detail for the the airline policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              3.3 Refunds can only be processed to the form of payment used at the time of booking and that all refunds
              are subject to the relevant airline's policy and a Mehman refund service fee. Please note that the
              deadline for requesting the refund of unreturned fees in writing is twelve (12) months from the date of
              purchase of the tickets or six (6) months from the date of the flight, if this is later.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul> 4. Passport, visas and health Requirements
            <li>
              4.1 Passport and visa regulations can change and you should therefore check with the relevant embassy well
              in advance of travel. It is your responsibility to be in possession of a valid passport and, if
              appropriate, a visa. It is important to remember to include all transit points in your journey which may
              also require you to obtain a visa. It can often take some time to obtain a visa, so you are advised to
              apply in plenty of time. We accept no responsibility for customers who do not possess the correct
              documents.
            </li>
            <li>
              4.2 Each destination has its own requirements as far as entry formalities, vaccinations, etc. which can
              also vary depending on the passenger's nationality. No incidents arising from the failure to comply with
              such official regulations will be considered the responsibility of Mehman. We therefore urge you to always
              verify the different formalities of the chosen destination or transit countries, as well as the time
              needed to take all the related steps.
            </li>
            <li>
              4.3. Mehman will not be liable if you or any person on your booking is denied boarding, deported or
              charged a fine due to non-compliance with the Travel Supplier’s or other governmental rules and
              regulations. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet the passport, visa and health requirements
              that you are travelling to (including all transit points).
