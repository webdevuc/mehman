        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt presented King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud with a Douglas DC-3
            propeller-driven aircraft. This historic occasion highlighted the Kingdom's steady rise in civil aviation
            and the establishment of Saudi Airlines.<br /><br /> The airline's initial focus was on transporting Hajj
            pilgrims from other cities in Saudi Arabia to Jeddah. After a few decades, the Douglas DC-3s were replaced
            by newer aircraft types, and Saudi quickly began flying passengers
            to various destinations all over the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Awards</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Saudi airline</b> has received numerous awards for its commitment to customer satisfaction and onboard
            comfort. APEX, one of the world's leading international airline organizations, will confer the "Five Star
            Global Airlines" designation
            in 2020.
        </p>
        <h2>Destinations</h2>
        <p>
            Many Saudia's customers are pleased with the airline's extensive global network of more than 130 locations.
            As a result, SkyTrax awarded Saudia the "World's Most Approved Airline" title in 2017.
            <br /><br /> Shortly, <b>Saudi Arabian Airlines</b> plans to acquire wide-body Airbus and Boeing planes.
            This will allow the national airline to operate with larger aircraft that can carry more passengers and
            improve the overall flying
            experience. This step would enable Saudi Arabia's national carrier to extend its network as part of the
            government's ambition to become a transportation hub. One hundred thirty-five overseas locations are
            expected to be added by the time
            it happens in 2022. According to the reports, new planes will take the place of older ones, allowing the
            narrow-body fleet to grow, while other aircraft will be retired altogether.

        <h2>Recent Updates about Saudi Arabian Airlines</h2>
        <p>
            Passengers will be able to fly between India and Saudi Arabia if they meet all of the standards of an air
            bubble agreement between the Indian government and Saudi Arabia's flag airline. There will be flights
            beginning on January 1, 2022. As a result of
            these bubbles, airlines' services are bolstered since they can serve customers from all over the globe and
            build international ties.<br /><br /> The airline intends to provide the most affordable flights to Al-'Ula
            feasible.
            Saudia, the country's flag airline, will fly 32 trips this year. Sixteen <b>saudia flights</b>saudia flights
            between Riyadh and Al'Ula, 12 flights between Al'Ula and Dammam, and four flights between Jeddah and Al'Ula
            are planned.<br /><br /> Direct flights to and from Uganda are also being planned by Saudi Arabian Airlines.
            Also, after the epidemic, there was a notable uptick in the population. There were 507 flights each day on
            the airline's domestic and foreign routes,
            totaling 76 destinations (49 courses). Riyadh and Jeddah, each with 128 flights, have made significant
            contributions. In addition, it has made 14 trips to Madinah and one to Dammam (30 flights).
        </p>
        <br /><br /> The operations of <b>Saudi Arabia airlines</b> are continually evolving.
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Between Paris and Al'Ula, the airline will provide nonstop service.
            </li>
            <li>
                The company's route map will include a new stop. Saudia, the country's flag airline, plans to begin
                flying to Thailand in the second quarter of 2022.
            </li>
            <li>
                Direct flights from Saudi Arabia to Thailand will be available.
            </li>
            <li>
                An agreement on the brief exchange of passengers between the United States and India has been reached
                through an air bubble.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This agreement is aimed at resuming regular international passenger flights. Flights between Thailand and
            Jeddah have been resuming, allowing pilgrims from Thailand to get there. They flew in from Bangkok to Jeddah
            on an ongoing journey. This was a once-in-a-lifetime
            opportunity since these classes were discontinued about 30 years ago. As a result of this step, the pilgrim
            service package, which includes everything from the time of their arrival to their departure, will be
            improved, contributing to
            the achievement of vision 2030. Opening the doors to Thai pilgrims to undertake Umrah and providing them
            with the opportunity to perform Umrah resulted in enhancing economic activity between Thailand and Saudi
            Arabia and improving relations
            between the two countries; this is a critical step.
        </p>

        <h2>Saudi airlines ticket price</h2>
        <br />
        <p>

            variables influence the price of Saudia airline tickets. Seat availability, departure time, and ticket type
            all impact the price of Saudia airline
            tickets. The cost of a Saudia flight varies depending on whether it is an internal or external trip.
